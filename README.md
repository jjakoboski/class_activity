# Physical Oceanography Curriculum Ideas

This repository is intended to include various oceanography-based class activities that I've designed as part of the [`Moana Project`](https://www.moanaproject.org/). In the future, I plan to add additional class material.

## Temperature and Current Velocity Mapping

The "Opotiki class" Jupyter notebook creates figures for year 9-10 students to practice creating contour and quiver plots using ocean temperature and current velocity.  Currently designed for Aotearoa New Zealand students.  It also creates "answer" figures to discuss with the class after they do the activity.

Requires access to MetService's 28-year ocean hindcast: https://www.moanaproject.org/hindcast
or could be edited for use with other hydrodynamic ocean model output.
